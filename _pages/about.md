Hey there! Welcome! This is my space(pun intended) where I document my journey as I dive into the nooks and crannies of the cyberworld. Fueled by my interest in cybersecurity, I will try my best to bring you along into this exciting world. I will be sharing my experiences, things that I learn and maybe some tools that I might create. It is fate that you chance upon this place, so I hope I can give you something to walk away with. And if you are considering to enter the field, I hope my sharing can serve as a glimpse to help you decide and help you find an entry point.

tldr; This is my cybersecurity blog.
