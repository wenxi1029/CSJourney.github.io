# Glimpse Into The Industry

When I first heard of the role of a pentester, I immediately thought of a show I watched a few years back, Mr Robot, where the protagonist does cool things while struggling with his morals and ethics. I was so intrigued by it that I went to scour the web for everything related to hacking and cybersecurity. I scanned through many different forms of media and it only got me more excited. While it is not all fancy and exhilarating like they show in movies, I do not see any deterence for me, even for the things, such as report writing, that many see as boring. 

Cybersecurity is a big field and many if not all industries requires it. For those who are new to cybersecurity, who are overwhelmed by the plethora of information available, let me organise some information below for your reference.

**Areas of cybersecurity** includes but not limited to:

  - Application security
  
  - Data loss prevention
  
  - Forensics
  
  - Incident response
  
  - Network security
  
  - Security architecture
  
  - Threat intelligence
  
  - Vulnerability management

You can start as a generalist and learn a bit of everything before you dive into your strong suit or interest and be a specialist.



## **Recommended Podcasts**:

If there is one place where you must start from, I would recommend the podcast series, **Darknet Diaries by Jack Rhysider**. Even if you are not intending to pursue cybersecurity as a career, you should still listen to a few of the episodes. The series gives you a glimpse of the world behind the cyber realm from the perspectives of people who have been on the wrong side and people who live to protect the rest. It can keep you entertained for a bus ride or during your morning wake up routine.

## **Certifications and Learning Resources**(Entry Level):
  
After consolidating advices and experiences from various people/sources, I have also put together a list of learning resources and entry level certifications to get, for those who want to enter the industry. These certifications opened doors for many people and gave them opportunity to do exciting jobs that they love.


  - CompTIA A+
  
  A good cert to get familiar with various aspects of IT, especially if you have no STEM background.
  
  Free video lessons: [Professor Messer](https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/220-1101/220-1101-video/220-1101-training-course/)
    
  - CCNA(Cisco Certified Network Associate)
  
  Foundation at networking by leading IT and networking company. To do anything on the net, understanding of the networking is a must.

  - JNCIA-Junos
  
  Another network certification with Juniper Networks specific contents.

## **Python Learning Resources**:
    
Also, if you don't have a STEM background and have no programming experience, I would recommend learning python for a start. It is relatively easy to pick up and its code is more friendly to read. There is also a strong community support available.
  
  [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  
  [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)
  
## **Hands-on Stuff** (beginner friendly and with learning resources):

For those who already have some IT/programming experience, time to get your feet wet with CTF(Capture The Flag) and Hack the Box. I will share more of what I did in another post.

I hope all these would be helpful to you who is reading this.

At the time of writing, I am studying for CompTIA A+ and JNCIA-Junos certs. Everyday, I am eager to start my study period in the morning and get some hands on with picoCTF and HTB at night.
