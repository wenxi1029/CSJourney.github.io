title: "Why Everyone Needs to Know Cybersecurity"
---

The nefarious black hats, the ethical white hats or even the grey hats. I am not saying everyone needs to be good with computers and engage in hacking activities. But everyone should learn about the dangers of the web and how to protect yourselves and your loved ones. Here are 3 reasons why:

## **Protect Your Assets**

In the current day and foreseeable future, many of our information and assets are digitalised. A large percentage of transactions happens online. We have digital banking, digital wallets, online brokerages, non-fungible tokens(NFT)/assets and cryptocurrency to name a few. In the past, our parents/grandparents have the risks of their stashed cash stolen physically from where they hide them or robbers in the alleys mugging them. Now, we can have all our money siphoned off without even us noticing until we check our accounts. Every online transaction, every assets stored online can be hijacked. I am not trying to be a fearmonger but many threat actors on the web targets their victim indiscriminately. You may not be very rich or famous but if your security is weak or non-existent, as the threat actors enumerate through all the vulnerabilities, you will be hit. And it is not even difficult for them because they just need to run and automate scripts. Nobody likes to have their things stolen from them. Don't be an open target and bolster up some security for your online assets.

## **Protect Your Privacy**

Other than our assets. Many of our lifes are practically on the internet. A simple search on google or with some open-source intelligence(OSINT) techniques, you can find out information about other people's family, which schools they went to, where they work, what they like or dislike, or even where they live. With social media, parts of our lifes are paraded for everyone to see, and whatever we put out there is going to stay there for a very long time. Those stories about crazy exes, or creepy stalkers did not come from nowhere. You don't want to become a victim and live your life in fear and paranoia. Technology when misused, enables these bad actors. You would want to do some house-keeping of your online presence if you have not done so.

## **Protect Others**

Regardless of how secure and robust the technology is, the weakest link in cybersecurity is almost always the human, especially one who has no awareness of any security protocols. Things such as weak or common passwords, greed for deals, complacency, laziness and many other human flaws can be exploited. The threat actors do not even need to use complex tricks to make people fall prey to them. Sometimes, all they need is some social engineering to get to their target. The easiest targets are often those without IT literacy, i.e the older generations or the young ones who do not know the magnitude of the dangers that their actions could bring. Therefore, go and get familiar with some common scam tactics such as phishing, and some security safeguards such as VPNs, privacy settings on browsers and phones etc. Then teach them to people around you, help them get protected.

If you are looking for resources on privacy and security to start with, I recommend [Intel Techniques by Michael Bazzell](https://inteltechniques.com/index.html). You may not need to go to such deep levels that are described on his web, but there are definitely useful things that you can pick up from there.

tldr; Protect yourself and others in the cyberworld where a large part of our lifes are.
